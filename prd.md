## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1. Architecture

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) First:**
  - Strive for 100% server-rendered pages and components where feasible.
  - Client-side components (`'use client'`) should only be used when absolutely necessary (e.g., for UI interactivity that cannot be achieved otherwise).
  - Follow Next.js App Router conventions.
- **Component Structure:**
  - Organize components logically, likely within `src/components/`.
  - Differentiate between server and client components clearly.
- **State Management:**
  - Minimize client-side state.
  - Utilize URL state and server components for managing application state where possible.
  - For complex client-side state, consider Zustand or Jotai (evaluate if needed).

### 5.2. Backend & API (for tools requiring server processing)

- **Server Actions:**
  - Use Next.js Server Actions for all form submissions and mutations.
  - Implement robust server-side validation for all inputs.
- **API Routes (if necessary):**
  - If external APIs are called directly from the client for specific tools (evaluate on a case-by-case basis), ensure they are secure and do not expose sensitive keys. Prefer routing through server actions or dedicated backend API routes where possible.
- **Rate Limiting:**
  - Implement rate limiting for tool usage to prevent abuse (e.g., per IP or per user if authentication is added later).
- **Error Handling:**
  - Graceful error handling on both server and client.
  - User-friendly error messages.

### 5.3. Security

- **Input Validation:**
  - Strict server-side validation for all user inputs to prevent XSS, injection attacks, etc.
  - Use libraries like Zod for schema validation.
- **Output Encoding:**
  - Ensure proper output encoding to prevent XSS.
- **Dependency Management:**
  - Keep dependencies up-to-date.
  - Scan for vulnerabilities regularly.
- **No Sensitive Data on Client:**
  - API keys or other sensitive credentials for third-party services used by tools must be handled exclusively on the server-side.
- **CSRF Protection:**
  - Next.js Server Actions provide built-in CSRF protection. Ensure this is leveraged correctly.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
  - Implement a strict CSP to mitigate XSS and other injection attacks.

### 5.4. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX)

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Fully responsive across all major devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Accessibility (a11y):**
  - Adhere to WCAG guidelines to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize for fast load times (Core Web Vitals).
  - Lazy load images and other non-critical resources.
- **Feedback:**
  - Provide clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., loading states, success/error messages).

### 5.5. Development Practices

- **Version Control:** Git (repository hosted on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
- **Code Quality:**
  - ESLint for linting.
  - Prettier for code formatting.
- **Testing:** (To be detailed further)
  - Unit tests for critical utility functions and components.
  - Integration tests for tool functionalities.
  - End-to-end tests for user flows.
- **Project Structure:**
  - Utilize the `src/` directory as confirmed.
  - Follow Next.js App Router conventions for routing and layouts.

## 6. Design and Theme

- **Visual Style:** Dynamic, fun, modern, and interactive.
- **Color Palette:** To be defined. Should support light and dark modes effectively.
- **Typography:** Clear and readable fonts.
- **Layout:** Intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Branding:** (Logo and branding elements to be developed if needed).

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:** Design with potential future growth in mind (more tools, more users).
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-documented, and modular code.
- **Reliability:** Ensure tools function consistently and accurately.

## 8. Assumptions

- The user has a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- Third-party services (e.g., for video downloading) have APIs or methods that can be legally and ethically used.

## 9. Risks and Mitigation

- **Third-Party API Changes:** APIs for downloading content can change or become restricted.
  - _Mitigation:_ Design tools to be adaptable. Have fallback options or be prepared to update implementations. Clearly communicate limitations.
- **Legal/Ethical Concerns:** Downloading copyrighted content.
  - _Mitigation:_ Include clear disclaimers regarding fair use and user responsibility. Do not store downloaded content on the server beyond the immediate processing needs.
- **Scalability of Processing-Intensive Tools:** Some tools (e.g., background removal) can be resource-intensive.
  - _Mitigation:_ Optimize algorithms. Consider serverless functions for heavy tasks. Implement robust rate limiting and potentially usage quotas.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Web applications are targets.
  - _Mitigation:_ Adhere strictly to security best practices outlined. Conduct regular security audits (even if informal initially).

## 10. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

- User accounts and authentication.
- Saving user preferences.
- History of used tools.
- Premium features or a subscription model (if applicable).
- Community features (e.g., suggesting new tools).

## 11. Open Questions

- Specific styling library/component library decision (e.g., Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI, or other).
- Choice of a specific database if user accounts/persistence become a requirement.
- Specific strategies for handling large file uploads/downloads.
