# Project Documentation Guidelines

## Context
- When creating new documentation, modifying existing docs, or understanding project documentation structure
- All documentation must be in Markdown (.md) format within the `/documentation/` directory

## Requirements
- File Location: All documentation files MUST be in `/documentation/` directory
- File Naming: Use descriptive kebab-case (e.g., `new-feature-guide.md`) without spaces or special characters
- Format: Write all documentation in clear, concise Markdown
- Structure: Use headings, lists, and code blocks appropriately to organize content
- Linking: Link to other relevant docs using relative paths
- Review: Have significant changes or new documents reviewed for clarity and accuracy
